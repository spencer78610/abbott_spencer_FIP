# Assignment
This wibsite is the FIP for all classes. As my final project I was taksed with making a website with four pages and I chose to do a skateboard shop named Spence Shredz selling everything to do with skateboards. I started by making a repo on github then added all the branches needed so I could just switch between them when I needed. Next I copyed all my files and images to their disired folders. Lastly I ran it through the code vaildator and corrected any mistakes I had.
 
 This site will be fixed width of 1920px and use a fixed 12 column grid.

 # Contribution html HP
First I changed all the html tags to scematic tags. 

Then I added all my images and text into html and added any other html tags where needed like 'h3' for text and 'li a' for nav bars. I also added links to link the pages together in my 'a' tags. 

I also went into html to add working buttons for my hero image, about section and newsletter. 

Lastly I ran it through the code vaildator and corrected any mistakes I had.

 # Contribution html GP
 I first changed the needed html tags to scematic tags before adding all my text, skateboard images in and hero image. I then added a bunch of 'h3', 'a' tags for the text boxes under the skateboards.

 Next I copy and pasted my nav bar and newsletter from my HP to my gallery in the smae spots. 
 
 I then added all my nav bar tags and links. I added a button for the hero image "read more". Lastly I ran it through the code vaildator and corrected any mistakes I had.

 # Contribution HP CSS
 
First I wanted to make sure all my css was linked properly especially the new html I added, so I went through checking it was all linked properly (classes and id's). Then I added my fonts in and background color. 

After everything was linked I added my hero image in the background so it could be behind all the text and nav bar so everything still showed. Except it wasn't clear enough so I dropped the opacicty making the nav and text pop. 

I then had to arrange my nav bar to fit the sign up/ login tab into the nav bar. I made the nav bar 'sticky' too so it would stay at the top of my page were ever you go. I then changed the border radius of the 'nav bar' and 'hero' buttons to make it more welcoming, aswell as adding a hover tag to make the button responsive. 

I had to add some margin and padding to seperate the 'h3' text before and after the products 'section' so it looked more in unity. I then changed the products boxs so that I could have the whole image but still keeping the text by adding "#product1 h3, #product2 h3,#product3 h3" and adding a background color then messing with the margin padding and border to get the text to fit the product boxs perfectly.

I changed the about page to make my skaters stand out more I did this by applying a gradient to the container.

For the contact us page I changed the border radius to 50px to make the form more rounded as well as changed the width of the sumbit button to match the rest of the form boxes.

The footer was challenging and gave me a battle the subscribe and email button did not want to move now matter the padding and marging or position. I figured out I had to use -px for the margin in order to get it where I wanted but after everything was in place. The newsletter text went out of place but that was as challenging I just exstended the width until it was long enough to be 'inline'.

 Lastly I took away all the not needed code and background colors before I ran it through the code vaildator and corrected any mistakes I had.

# Contribution GP CSS

First I copy and pasted the nav bar, social icons and logos and changed classes so everything linked up.

I then added the main hero image but ran into some opacity issues forcing me to go back into photoshop and re do the hero image before placing it back in the site. I did this by using the gallery container so all the text would still show through without the image covering everything.

Next I had to move the three dots 'image slider' since it wasn't on top of the hero image it was below. I did this by adjusting the margin, for the 'h3' tag Skateboards I changed the font size to 48px and change the color to white.

Next I copy and pasted the boxes from the products on the HP so they were identical keeping the theme going. I did have to change some padding and margin to fit the new products but after switching some classes everything went into place.

I had to do some shuffling with the newsletter by changing the postioning and font color. I took away all the not needed code and background colors. Before finishing it by running it through the validator. There was a few errors but nothing more than a few minutes of code.

Then added the rest of my images in the place holder spots.

Next I added the contact form buttons and the footer newsletter buttons just by copy and pasting the code from my desktop index.
